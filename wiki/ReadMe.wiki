= Django Voting =

This is a generic voting application for use in Django projects.

== Installation ==

Use the following command to check out the latest source:

{{{
svn checkout http://django-voting.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ voting
}}}

== Usage ==

Put this app into your project's `INSTALLED_APPS` setting and run `syncdb` to create its tables.

The following is a sample `urls.py` which demonstrates setting up generic views for voting on a `Model`:

{{{
from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
from voting.views import vote_on_object
from shop.apps.products.models import Widget

widget_dict = {
    'model': Widget,
    'template_object_name': 'widget',
    'template_name': 'shop/widget_confirm_vote.html'
}

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^widgets/(?P<object_id>\d+)/(?P<direction>up|down|clear)vote/?$',
        vote_on_object, widget_dict),
)
}}}
